# Solution
Not being content simply retrieving the information as requested, I created some validation and failsafes throughout the function:

[tropo_ip.py](../master/tropo_ip.py) has several extra validation features:

1. Checks for proper server address

2. Checks for proper server name

3. Validations to check if IP Address is accurate

4. Checks for populated list
